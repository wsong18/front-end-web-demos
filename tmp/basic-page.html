    The first line must be a DOCTYPE. It tells the browser what kind of page to
    render (html 5, xhtml, html4, xml, etc.).

    The root of the tree is the <html> tag. Notice that tags must be closed
    (scroll down to the last line to see that even <html> is closed
    with </html>

    <!-- is the start of a comment.

    Here's how we close a comment:
    -->
    <head>
        <!-- the head element lets us provide meta information -->

        <title>Basic HTML Page</title>
        <!-- like the page title (check out the title of the browser window) -->

    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- the body is where put all the things we want to display. -->

        <h1>This is a basic html page.</h1>
        <!--
            A level 1 header is a block level tag.

            It means that all of this page is about the topic described by the
            text in the h1 tag.

        <p>Notice how html is not white space sensitive:     There are five spaces before this sentence.


        And this one is three lines down.</p>

        <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
        <p>This paragraph has some text marked up by inline tags. Inline tags
            might be <a href="#">an anchor tag (used to make links)</a>,
            <em>emphasized text with the &lt;em&gt; tag</em>, or <strong>or
            strongly emphasized</strong>. One inline element comes with no
            style by default: <span>the span element</span>
        </p>

        <h2>Entities</h2>
        <p>This paragraph has some special characters created using html
            entities: &gt; &lt; &amp;. This lets us render potentially
            dangerous glyphs (like &gt;) which could be interpreted by the
            browser as code.
        </p>

        <h2>Images</h2>
        <p>This is a paragraph with an image. <img src="3d-dom-image.png">.</p>

        <p>Images can also be by themselves:</p>
        <img src="3d-dom-image.png">
        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>This is an unorderd list</li>
            <li>
                What makes it unordered is:
                <ul>
                    <li>The &lt;ul&gt; parent tag</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>It gets rendered with bullets by default.</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>This is an orderd list</li>
            <li>
                What makes it ordered is:
                <ol>
                    <li>The &lt;ol&gt; parent tag</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>It gets rendered with numbers by default.</li>
        </ol>
