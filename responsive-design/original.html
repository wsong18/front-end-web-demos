 <h2>Overview of the program</h2>

 <p>
  This unique and innovative degree program was created to address the
 need for knowledgeable software developers, skilled in both the
 technical and non-technical aspects of business information technology.
 A strong theoretical base is developed through extensive practical
 experience on a variety of computer platforms. The program also
 emphasizes development of English communications and business skills
 for today's knowledge-based economy, and includes features such as a
 paid co-op work term that prepares graduates who are fully functional
 upon employment.
 </p>

 <p>
  The Bachelor of Technology (Software Development), known as the BSD
 Program, is a four-year (eight semester) program that offers students
 the opportunity to start in either September or January. Students learn
 at Seneca's modern TEL (Technology Enhanced Learning) and SEQ (Steven
 E. Quinlan) buildings, located on the York University campus in
 Toronto.
 </p>

 <blockquote class=highlighted1>
  <p>
  Look around you - every day, society increases its dependence on
  computer technology, and programmability is the defining
  characteristic of computers.
  </p>

  <p>
  Without software - the detailed sets of instructions telling the
  computer exactly what to do - a computer does nothing. Software
  developers are the key people shaping the solutions of today and
  tomorrow.
  </p>
 </blockquote>

 <h3>What you study</h3>

 <ul>
  <li>Programming languages and algorithms</li>

  <li>Operating system platforms</li>

  <li>Systems analysis and design methodologies</li>

  <li>Internet development techniques</li>

  <li>Information security</li>

  <li>Database technology</li>
 </ul>

 <p>
  Compared to other degree programs that teach computer programming,
 Seneca's program offers more real-world opportunities and experience.
 For example, Seneca's enthusiasm for Open Source development models,
 combined with the technical and practical focus of the curriculum, has
 created expertise that enables students to contribute to the world-wide
 Open Source cummunity, thereby gaining experience that can lead to
 fast-track opportunities.
 </p>

 <h2>Software Development program curriculum</h2>

 <blockquote class=highlighted1>
  <p>
  The strength of the curriculum is a highlight of the Software
  Development program. The curriculum was created through decades of
  real-world experience and extensive consultation with information
  technology industry and employer groups.
  </p>
 </blockquote>

 <p>
  Gaining extensive practical experience on a number of computing
 platforms, students study various programming languages, multiple
 operating system platforms, internet development techniques,
 information security, and database technology.
 </p>

 <p>
  The School's relationship with the Open Source coummunity provides
 unique opportunities to learn about Open Source methodologies, and
 contribute to prominent Open Source projects around the world.
 </p>

 <p>
  We designed this program to be unique, yet matched to the needs of
 today's business community. There's no other program like this one at
 any other Ontario college or university.
 </p>

 <h3>Areas of study by topic</h3>

 <p>
  The chart shows the program's topic areas, and the proportion of
 thime spent on each.
 </p>

 <p>
  <img class=indent2 alt="" src="assets/images/areasofstudy.png"></p>

 <p>
  It's a well-balanced program, where you concentrate on technical
 subjects, and also learn soft skills that are personally rewarding, and
 make you a more employable graduate.
 </p>

 <h3>Academics - what to expect</h3>

 <p>
  The Software Development program is challenging. There are
 approximately 20 hours of classes per week. In addition to that, you
 can expect to spend an additional 20 to 40 hours (or more) on your
 studies, as individual effort, or as part of a small group. For best
 results, we recommend that you liimit your outside time
 commitments.
